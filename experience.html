							<h3> Young Age</h3>
							<p>I started working at a very young age. When I was 11 years old, my mother would take me every Saturday to go work with her at an elderly couples house. My mom was a housekeeper and on Saturdays she had one home in which we would go together and she would pay me ten dollars to help her. At the time, ten dollars was a lot but then I grew older and those ten dollars werent enough so she started paying me twenty dollar a week to go help her. I remember I was incharge of the dusting and bathrooms of one side of the house while she was in charge of the Kitchen and the rest of the home. This first job taught me to have very good attention to detail and at the same time be efficient with my time. My Mother was always behind pressuring me to move fast.</p>
							<p>Then, When I turned sixteen years old, I remeber telling my mom that I wanted a real job since I was old enough. She was hesitant at first because she didn't want me losing focus on my school but I promised both my parents that I wouldn't. Well, one Saturday she drove me to our local McDonalds to apply and I spoke with the manager who interviewed me and gave me a position that same day. Working at McDonald's taught me how to multitask and build good customer service skills but working and going to school really taught me how to balance my time. I had to learn how to balance School, work, friends, family, and house chores at such a young age. </p>
							<p> After working at McDonald's for nine months, I realized that the workload was becoming hard to upkeep and decided to start looking for a different type of job. Ideally, I wanted to work at a retail store. I applied to all my local retail stores and was hired at Walgreens. I worked at Walgreens for about a year. At Walgreens I learned good organization skills from organizing the shelves every night in order to make the store look pretty and full. I also sharpened my problem solving skills from customer handling experiences. I left Walgreens because I decided to join the Marine Corps. </p>
							<h3>Professional</h3>
							<p> My time in the Marine Corps was very bittersweet. It was my first professional Job/Career. I started working with the logistics section as an Ammunition Technician. The duties of an Ammunition Technician consists of assisting the operation managers with loading Ammunition and prepping transportation vehicles with all the necessary material needed for safe Ammunition handling during its transportation to set ranges. I used to work in the Marine Corps full time and go to community college during the evening in order to get ahead in my schooling. With time, I picked up the role of operations manager which was also a leadership position because my ranking was higher and I had peers who looked up to me and depended on me. Operation Managers had more responsibilities than the technicians and had to attend meeting with important people to forecast Ammuntion, discuss trainings that teams needed, and make sure it all happens with little error possible. During my time in the Marine Corps, I was fortunate enough to attend CompTIA's Security plus Certification Training which sparked my interest even more for the Computer Science industry.</p>
							<p> Once my time in the Marine Corps was done, I took a break from working for about a year and focused on School. After that year, I started working at AT&T as a Sales Associate. In the Summer of 2022, I interned with a consulting company (66Degrees). They are partners of Google Cloud. During this internship, I was fortunate enough to get my Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineering Certificate and gain a lot of experience with Google Cloud. After the internship was over, I started working at T-Mobile; also in Sales. </p>
