							<h2>Hello! &#x1F44B; </h2>	
							<p>I am a self driven Latina woman born and raised in the Chicagoland area. On top of my passion for Program Engineering, I love to travel and work out. I was in the Marine Corps for four years which helped me develop that passion for travel and the gym. I'd say one of the coolest places I've travelled to has been to Santorini, Greece with my Mother. I also deployed to Kuwait and Iraq which was an awesome experience yet a hard one because I was far away from my family for a long period of time and I am a very family oriented person.  </p>
							<p>I can say that I am very proud of myself because I have accomplished way more than what I have wanted to. 10 years ago, I had not envisioned having accomplished everything that I have accomplished and being where I am today. One thing about me is that I always go above and beyond. I am very focused and organized which has aided me in my achievements. I love having fun but when its time to put my head down and focus, I grind. My parents instilled a lot of grit in me growing up and I am very proud of that. However, I am always looking for ways to grow and improve my myself, my work, and everything else that surrounds me and builds me. I will humbly say that I am not perfect and I recognize that there is alwasy room for improvement in life.</p>
